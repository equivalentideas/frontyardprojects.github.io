### Getaroom @ Frontyard

You have a provocation to explore. A project to begin. A local problem to solve. A team of pro-active people to assemble. We have the space and a network of people to connect you with.

Frontyard is a space for research, imagining, problem-solving, doing & not doing, meeting, talking, and making time. There are 2 short-term (1-2 weeks) residency spaces for artists and non-artists, and an open door policy for hosting people in our workshop, garden and library if your project needs a place to grow after your residency ends.

In return for the space and time to think, Frontyard asks for a small gift of time from each resident. That could mean participating as a provocateur in a futuring session, giving a public talk, sharing skills via a workshop, symposium, film night, performance, or something else you think is important for the community.

**Practical Stuff:**

- In each Getaroom - table, chair, shelves, working wall
- Access Hours - round the clock
- Public Access and Programs - Thursday to Sunday and Thursday night
- Internet - yes
- Staying over - no
- Other assets - workshop area, small kitchen, kitchen garden, library, hammock, pro-active people!
